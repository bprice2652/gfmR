Description: This package provides methodology to preform automatic response category
combinations in multinomial logistic regression. There are functions for both cross valdiation
and AIC for model selection.  The method provides regerssion coefficient estimates
that may be useful for better understanding the true probaility distribution of
multinomial logisitic regression when category probabilities are similar. THESE METHODS
ARE NOT RECCOMEND FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF PREDICTOR VARIABLES!
